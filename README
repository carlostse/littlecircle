# ARCHFLAGS=-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future pip install pil --allow-external pil --allow-unverified pil

[Method 2]
1. install brew
2. brew install libjpeg
3. download PIL http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
4. edit setup.py in PIL
- JPEG_ROOT = None
+ JPEG_ROOT = libinclude("/usr/local/Cellar/jpeg/8d")
5. python setup.py build
6. sudo python setup.py install

== Run the project locally ==
